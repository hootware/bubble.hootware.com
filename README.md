#Bubble - A spirit level web app
The app uses lots of HTML5 goodness and yummy device motion events to mimic what a native mobile app can do

##Device support
Any mobile browser that can handle the device motion event. Which at the moment is iOS 4.2+ and Android 4.0+. Let me know of any others you come across :)
